For folder with files, it will list the names of the files.

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?

git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

To see how many changes, deletions, and other modifications would be added.
It can also tell you if you are up to date on changes (though this means you likely forgot to save most of the time).

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

It adds the changes made in your code editor (referred to by Terminal as .) to your client version of the repository.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?

That would be:

git commit -m "(message)"

The message put in quotations is part of the change log and is an almost necessary addition for any changes.
It will appear in the changelog of the repository, keeping an up to date log.
No one likes to do something that was already done, commmunication!
